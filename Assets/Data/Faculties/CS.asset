  programDetails: "Undergraduates will find that our BSCS program emphasizes on developing
    the practicality of the knowledge to real-world use. Students learn not only
    the fundamentals of computer science, but also vigorously on how the knowledge
    can be applied. Classrooms, learning facilities, and research labs collaborate
    hand-in-hand to make this happen, as you will find that students learn not only
    inside the classroom. CS faculty members maintain an extensive technology network
    in industrial partners so that \u201Creal-world\u201D practices are truly real-world
    and bring out the most optimal benefits for the students.\nFirst, our candidates
    begin with the masteries of computer programming and the essences of computer
    science. Then, whether their interest is in creating software innovations, getting
    a software engineering career in big tech companies, or furthering their study
    in postgraduate levels, students can select to pursue their track of elective
    courses that fits their needs, spending their senior year working on real-world
    projects or software innovations."
